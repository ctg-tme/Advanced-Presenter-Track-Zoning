# Advanced Presenter Track Zone Builder

[![Example Coordinate Capture](/images/ExampleCoordniates.png)](#)

The Advanced Presenter Track Zone Builder (APTZB) provides an interface that allows you to define a custom Presenter Track Trigger Zone.

This doesn't modify the default behavior of the presenter track feature, but it allows for more precise zoning in your area to trigger the presenter track solution.

## FAQ

- What's the line that follows my mouse pointer?
  - It's the preview line, so you can see where the next line connects

- What's the dotted line connecting the Starting Dot and Ending Dot?
  - The the Autocomplete Line
    - You don't need to connect the Starting and Endpoint Dot, [xConfiguration Cameras PresenterTrack TriggerZone](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.Cameras.PresenterTrack.TriggerZone/) assumes those 2 are connected by default

- Why can't I intersect the lines?
  - The [xConfiguration Cameras PresenterTrack TriggerZone](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.Cameras.PresenterTrack.TriggerZone/) API doesn't handle intersecting lines well. It's best to avoid where possible. The canvas does it's best at preventing you from doing so if it's detected
